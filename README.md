# Media Player control Using Hand Gestures Detection.



## Info
Accurate gesture control!  CNNs and RNNs trained on hand gestures, like play, pause, volume, track selection. 
PyAutoGUI simulates keypresses, powered by SqueezeNet for near-perfect accuracy.


## Instructions
1. Install the dependencies
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Collect images for training.
```sh
$ python3 gather_images.py
```

3. Train the model
```sh
$ python3 train.py
```

4. Run the media player and control it using the hand gestures.
```sh
$ python3 play.py
```

## FEEL IT... :)
